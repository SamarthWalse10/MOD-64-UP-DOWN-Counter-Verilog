# MOD-64-UP-DOWN-Counter-Verilog
Implementation of a MOD-64 Reconfigurable UP/DOWN Counter using Verilog.    

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a MOD-64 Reconfigurable UP/DOWN Counter. The project focuses on designing and implementing a digital circuit using J-K flip-flops to create a counter capable of counting up or down based on the clock signal.
## Overview
The implementation is done in Verilog hardware description language (HDL).
The counter is designed to be reconfigurable and can be easily modified for different counting requirements.
Simulation and testing were performed using Xilinx Vivado 2021.2.
## Contents
The src directory contains the Verilog source code for the MOD-64 Reconfigurable UP/DOWN Counter.
The sim directory includes the simulation files and test bench code.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/SamarthWalse10/MOD-64-UP-DOWN-Counter-Verilog.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Verilog development environment.
3. Compile and synthesize the Verilog source code.
4. Simulate the design using the provided test bench.
5. Analyze the simulation results and verify the functionality of the MOD-64 Reconfigurable UP/DOWN Counter.
